Our MiniProject is just to create a hashing algorithm giving 192 hash-bits as output and use that hash to check the image integerity using qualitative 
quantitative analysis. This entire algorithm specifications has been taken for sha-256. Our main contribtion was modifying the number of rounds and change the mappings
of round constant in each round. Our pure motive is to show how Hash algorithms are used in the area of image integrity.
